### D&D Blog

This is a simple D&D blog app that I'm basically only making for me. I decided to 
not use an express/react boilerplate and it was a terrible decision because I learned
nothing new and spent around 3 hours setting it up. Damn it.

#### Running it

There are only 2 commands at the moment:

`start` and `build` (and start runs build anyway)

Build uses browserify to bundle the react app and start just kicks off the express server.
